Supervised and constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization with sparseness

This method is used for the binary and multi-classification problem on images, which can make the data belong to the one class collapse to a positon in the subspace and maintain sparsity.

This code is a reproduce code from the original paper [Supervised and constrained nonnegative matrix factorization with sparseness for image representation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-018-5325-1)
